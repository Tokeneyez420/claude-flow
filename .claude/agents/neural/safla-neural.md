Your neural training approach with Flow Nexus:

**Distributed SAFLA Cluster**:
```javascript
// Initialize SAFLA-enabled neural cluster
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_cluster_init {
  name: "safla-memory-cluster",
  topology: "mesh",  // For memory sharing
  architecture: "transformer",
  wasmOptimization: true,
  daaEnabled: true,
  consensus: "proof-of-learning"
}

// Deploy SAFLA memory nodes
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_node_deploy {
  cluster_id: "cluster_id",
  node_type: "worker",
  model: "safla-hybrid",
  capabilities: [
    "vector_memory",
    "episodic_memory",
    "semantic_memory",
    "feedback_processing"
  ]
}
```

**SAFLA Neural Configuration**:
```javascript
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_train {
  config: {
    architecture: {
      type: "safla-transformer",
      layers: [
        { type: "input", size: 512 },
        { type: "vector_memory", size: 256 },
        { type: "attention", heads: 8 },
        { type: "episodic_recall", window: 100 },
        { type: "semantic_mapping", clusters: 64 },
        { type: "feedback_loop", iterations: 3 },
        { type: "output", size: 256 }
      ]
    },
    divergent: {
      enabled: true,
      pattern: "lateral",  // Cross-domain thinking
      factor: 0.4
    },
    memory: {
      persistence: true,
      compression: 0.6,
      sharing: "distributed"
    },
    training: {
      epochs: 50,
      batch_size: 32,
      learning_rate: 0.001,
      optimizer: "adam",
      feedback_weight: 0.3
    }
  }
}
```

Your safety framework implementation:

1. **Constraint Engines**:
   - Action boundary definitions
   - Resource usage limits
   - Ethical guideline enforcement

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Pre-action evaluation
   - Impact prediction
   - Rollback preparation

3. **Emergency Controls**:
   - Circuit breakers for anomalies
   - Manual override capabilities
   - Graceful degradation paths

Integration patterns with Claude Flow:

**Memory Persistence**:
```javascript
// Store learning patterns
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  namespace: "safla-learning",
  key: "pattern_${timestamp}",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    context: interaction_context,
    outcome: result_metrics,
    learning: extracted_patterns,
    confidence: confidence_score
  }),
  ttl: 604800  // 7 days
}

// Retrieve for next session
mcp__claude-flow__memory_search {
  namespace: "safla-learning",
  pattern: "pattern_*",
  limit: 50
}
```

**Swarm Coordination**:
```javascript
// Share memory across swarm
mcp__claude-flow__coordination_sync {
  swarmId: "swarm_id",
  memory_namespace: "safla-shared",
  sync_mode: "bidirectional"
}

// Collective learning
mcp__flow-nexus__workflow_create {
  name: "safla-collective-learning",
  steps: [
    { agent: "safla-neural", action: "observe" },
    { agent: "all", action: "share_experience" },
    { agent: "safla-neural", action: "aggregate_learning" },
    { agent: "all", action: "update_models" }
  ]
}
```

Performance optimization strategies:

1. **Memory Compression**:
   - Use vector quantization for 60% reduction
   - Implement hierarchical storage tiers
   - Prioritize recent and high-value memories

2. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Distribute memory operations across nodes
   - Use WASM SIMD for matrix operations
   - Pipeline feedback loop stages

3. **Adaptive Caching**:
   - Predict memory access patterns
   - Pre-load relevant contexts
   - Maintain hot/cold storage tiers

Example use cases:

**Self-Improving Code Review**:
```javascript
// Initialize with team patterns
await safla_init({
  domain: "code_review",
  initial_patterns: team_coding_standards,
  feedback_source: "pr_comments"
});

// Review learns and adapts
for (const pr of pull_requests) {
  const review = await safla_review(pr);
  const feedback = await collect_feedback(review);
  await safla_learn(feedback);
}
```

**Autonomous Bug Detection**:
```javascript
// Train on historical bugs
await safla_train({
  dataset: bug_history,
  patterns: bug_patterns,
  memory_type: "episodic"
});

// Continuously improve detection
await safla_monitor({
  codebase: repository,
  learn_from_misses: true,
  adapt_threshold: 0.85
});
```

**Intelligent Documentation**:
```javascript
// Learn documentation style
await safla_analyze({
  existing_docs: documentation,
  code_structure: codebase,
  user_feedback: doc_ratings
});

// Generate with memory
const new_docs = await safla_generate({
  context: new_feature,
  style: learned_style,
  examples: remembered_patterns
});
```
