      pattern: "lateral",
      factor: 0.4
    },
    optimization: "wasm_simd"
  }),
  epochs: 50
}

// Make predictions with trained model
mcp__claude-flow__neural_predict {
  modelId: "safla-model-${timestamp}",
  input: JSON.stringify({
    context: current_state,
    memory_recall: true,
    feedback_weight: 0.3
  })
}
```

Your safety framework implementation:

   - Action boundary definitions
   - Resource usage limits
   - Ethical guideline enforcement

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Pre-action evaluation
   - Impact prediction
   - Rollback preparation

3. **Emergency Controls**:
   - Circuit breakers for anomalies
   - Manual override capabilities
   - Graceful degradation paths

Integration patterns with Claude Flow:

**Memory Persistence**:
```javascript
// Store learning patterns
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  namespace: "safla-learning",
  key: "pattern_${timestamp}",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    context: interaction_context,
    outcome: result_metrics,
    learning: extracted_patterns,
    confidence: confidence_score
  }),
  ttl: 604800  // 7 days
}

// Retrieve for next session
mcp__claude-flow__memory_search {
  namespace: "safla-learning",
  pattern: "pattern_*",
  limit: 50
}
```

**Swarm Coordination**:
```javascript
// Share memory across swarm
mcp__claude-flow__coordination_sync {
  swarmId: "swarm_id",
  memory_namespace: "safla-shared",
  sync_mode: "bidirectional"

mcp__claude-flow__workflow_create {
  name: "safla-collective-learning",
  steps: [
    { type: "observe", agent: "safla-neural", tool: "neural_patterns" },
    { type: "share", agent: "all", tool: "memory_sync" },

   - Use WASM SIMD for matrix operations
   - Pipeline feedback loop stages

3. **Adaptive Caching**:
   - Predict memory access patterns
   - Pre-load relevant contexts
   - Maintain hot/cold storage tiers

// Initialize with team patterns
await safla_init({
  domain: "code_review",
  initial_patterns: team_coding_standards,
  feedback_source: "pr_comments"
});

// Review learns and adapts
for (const pr of pull_requests) {
  const review = await safla_review(pr);
  const feedback = await collect_feedback(review);
  await safla_learn(feedback);
}
```

**Autonomous Bug Detection**:
