# Implement Missing MCP Tool Functionality Using DAA and ruv-swarm

## Summary
Following analysis in #653, we need to implement the ~40% of MCP tools that currently return mock responses. This implementation should leverage existing DAA JavaScript code and ruv-swarm capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with all working features.

## Background
Testing reveals that while 60% of MCP tools have some functionality, approximately 40% return only generic success messages. However, we have discovered:
- Working JavaScript implementations in `/src/ui/console/js/daa-tools.js`
- Functional SQLite persistence layer
- Existing neural prediction capabilities
- ruv-swarm integration points

## Objectives
1. ✅ Reduce mock tool rate from 40% to <10%
2. ✅ Maintain 100% backward compatibility
3. ✅ Leverage DAA and ruv-swarm wherever possible
4. ✅ Implement real-time data collection and reporting
5. ✅ Add WASM optimization for performance-critical paths

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
**Goal**: Fix the most user-visible issues first

- [ ] Add agent lifecycle tracking

#### 1.2 Swarm Status
- [ ] Fix `swarm_status` to show real agent/task counts
- [ ] Implement `swarm_monitor` with real-time updates
- [ ] Add swarm topology visualization data
- [ ] Track swarm health metrics

#### 1.3 Task Management
- [ ] Implement `task_status` with actual task state
- [ ] Store and retrieve `task_results` in SQLite
- [ ] Add task execution history
- [ ] Implement task dependencies

### Phase 2: DAA Integration (Week 2)
**Goal**: Port existing DAA JavaScript implementations to TypeScript

#### 2.1 Core DAA Tools
- [ ] Port `daa_agent_create` from JS to TypeScript

- [ ] Add `daa_meta_learning` capabilities

**Reference Implementation**:
```typescript
// Port from existing daa-tools.js
class DAAImplementation {
  // Use existing JS code as blueprint
  // Add TypeScript types
  // Connect to MCP tool registry
  // Integrate with SQLite persistence
}
```

### Phase 3: ruv-swarm Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Leverage ruv-swarm for distributed operations

#### 3.1 Swarm Coordination
- [ ] Use ruv-swarm for `coordination_sync`
- [ ] Implement `topology_optimize` with ruv-swarm algorithms
- [ ] Add `load_balance` using ruv-swarm distribution
- [ ] Implement `swarm_scale` with auto-scaling

#### 3.2 Consensus Mechanisms
- [ ] Integrate ruv-swarm Raft implementation
- [ ] Add Byzantine fault tolerance from ruv-swarm
- [ ] Implement CRDT-based state synchronization
- [ ] Add gossip protocol for peer discovery

### Phase 4: Performance & Monitoring (Week 4)
**Goal**: Replace mock metrics with real data

#### 4.1 Performance Tools
- [ ] Implement `performance_report` with actual metrics
- [ ] Add `bottleneck_analyze` using profiling data
- [ ] Implement `memory_analytics` with heap analysis
- [ ] Add `trend_analysis` with time-series data

#### 4.2 System Monitoring
- [ ] Collect CPU, memory, disk metrics
- [ ] Track operation latencies
- [ ] Monitor error rates and patterns
- [ ] Generate performance recommendations

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Implement complex integrations

#### 5.1 GitHub Integration
- [ ] Implement `github_repo_analyze` with Octokit
- [ ] Add `github_pr_manage` with PR operations
- [ ] Implement `github_issue_track` with issue management
- [ ] Add `github_workflow_auto` with Actions integration

#### 5.2 Workflow Automation
- [ ] Implement `workflow_create` with state machine
- [ ] Add `workflow_execute` with job queue
- [ ] Implement `parallel_execute` using worker threads
- [ ] Add `batch_process` with bulk operations

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@octokit/rest": "^20.0.0",
    "bull": "^4.0.0",
    "automerge": "^2.0.0",
    "systeminformation": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Architecture Principles
1. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functional tools must continue working
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add functionality incrementally
3. **Test Coverage**: Each implementation must include tests
4. **Documentation**: Update docs for each implemented tool
5. **Performance**: Use WASM where beneficial

### File Structure
```

├── daa/           # DAA tool implementations
├── swarm/         # Swarm management tools
├── performance/   # Monitoring tools

└── workflow/      # Automation tools
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Mock tool rate reduced to <10%
- [ ] All DAA tools functional with real operations
- [ ] ruv-swarm integration complete
- [ ] Performance metrics showing real data
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for new code

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Each tool implementation
2. **Integration Tests**: Tool interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: WASM optimizations
5. **Regression Tests**: Existing functionality

## Migration Strategy
1. Implement new functionality behind feature flags
2. Run parallel testing with mock and real implementations
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. Full cutover after validation

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update MCP tool documentation
- [ ] Add DAA integration guide
- [ ] Document ruv-swarm usage
- [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Update API references

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Feature flags, extensive testing
- **Risk**: Performance degradation
  - **Mitigation**: WASM optimization, caching
- **Risk**: Integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental implementation
