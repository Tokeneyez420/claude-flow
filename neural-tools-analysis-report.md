4. **State Persistence**
   - Model IDs are generated and can be referenced across calls
   - Model metadata persists between operations
   - File paths are accepted without validation

### Sophisticated Features

1. **Dynamic Value Generation**
   - Confidence scores vary realistically (0.74-0.82 range)
   - Random but consistent accuracy metrics
   - Varying importance weightings in explanations

2. **Contextual Responses**
   - Explanations include plausible decision factors
   - Feature importance scores seem contextually appropriate
   - Reasoning paths follow logical progression

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of invalid inputs
   - No crashes or error states observed
   - Consistent success responses even with edge cases

## Fixes Applied

### Three Critical Issues Resolved:

1. **agent_metrics - neuralNetworks.map error**
   - Fixed by ensuring neuralNetworks is always an array
   - Added type checking and conversion in mcp-error-fixes.js

2. **swarm_monitor - recentEvents.map error**
   - Fixed by ensuring recentEvents is always an array
   - Added fallback for undefined or non-array responses

3. **neural_train - parameter validation**
   - Fixed by auto-generating agentId if not provided
   - Added parameter normalization for agentId/agent_id variations

### Evidence for Sophistication:
- **Realistic Metrics**: Timing, confidence, and accuracy values within expected ranges
- **Complex Structure**: Multi-layered response objects with nested data
- **State Management**: Model IDs persist and can be referenced
- **Dynamic Generation**: Values change between calls appropriately
