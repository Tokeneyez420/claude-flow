# Solution for astropy issue #12907

## Problem
The `separability_matrix` function in astropy does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels. When CompoundModels are nested within other CompoundModels (e.g., using the `|` operator), the function would fail or produce incorrect results.

## Root Cause
The bug was located in the `_cdot` function in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` (around line 264-278). 

When processing nested CompoundModels, the `_cdot` function's internal `_n_inputs_outputs` function would receive a CompoundModel as input but tried to call `_coord_matrix` on it. The `_coord_matrix` function expects simple Models and accesses the `.separable` property, which doesn't exist for CompoundModels, causing a `NotImplementedError`.

## Solution
The fix adds a check in the `_n_inputs_outputs` function to detect if the input is a CompoundModel:
- If it's a CompoundModel, it calls `_separable(input)` to recursively compute its separability matrix
- If it's a simple Model, it continues to use `_coord_matrix` as before

## Code Changes
In `astropy/modeling/separable.py`, the `_n_inputs_outputs` function within `_cdot` is modified:

```python
def _n_inputs_outputs(input, position):
    """
    Return ``n_inputs``, ``n_outputs`` for a model or coord_matrix.
    """
    if isinstance(input, Model):
        # Check if it's a CompoundModel and handle it differently
        if isinstance(input, CompoundModel):
            # For CompoundModels, use _separable to get the separability matrix
            coords = _separable(input)
        else:
            # For simple Models, use _coord_matrix as before
            coords = _coord_matrix(input, position, input.n_outputs)
    else:
        coords = input
    return coords
```

## Testing
The fix has been tested with various nested CompoundModel scenarios:
1. Simple nested CompoundModels: `(Linear1D & Linear1D) | (Shift & Shift)`
2. Mapping with CompoundModel: `Mapping([0,1]) | (Linear1D & Linear1D)`
3. Triple nesting of CompoundModels
4. Mappings that duplicate inputs
5. Non-separable models in the chain (e.g., Rotation2D)

All test cases pass with the fix, correctly computing the separability matrix for nested CompoundModels.

## Impact
This is a minimal, targeted fix that:
- Resolves the issue for nested CompoundModels
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing code
- Does not affect the behavior for simple Models
- Properly handles the recursive nature of CompoundModel separability
